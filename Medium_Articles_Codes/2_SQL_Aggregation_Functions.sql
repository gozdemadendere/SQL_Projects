SQL Aggregation Functions

Weâ€™ll cover COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, ROUND, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, WITH ROLLUP.

NOTE - The order should be like this:
GROUP BY ...
HAVING ...
ORDER BY ...


NOTE - We should write city twice:
WHERE (city = "San Jose") OR (city = "Salt Lake City")
