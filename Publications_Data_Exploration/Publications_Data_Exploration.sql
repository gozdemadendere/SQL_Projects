PUBLICATIONS Data Exploration

The main purpose of the this project is to answer the business questions.

In this project, I analyzed a real-world dataset gaining the following skills:
* SQL syntax and how to use SQL: This part includes SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, NOT, AND, OR, IN, LIKE, wildcards, NULL, IS NOT NULL, ORDER BY.
* SQL Aggregation: This part includes COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING.
* SQL Analysis: This is where I thought analytically and answer many analytical questions using advanced SQL techniques. This part includes JOINS, CASE statements.

The differences between =, LIKE and IN

= :   takes a single value to look for and matches only the exact value.

LIKE: takes a single to look for and allows wildcards (%, _) to match patterns in different positions.

IN :  takes many values to look for, such as a list of values, but does not work with the wildcards (%, _).

    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)
